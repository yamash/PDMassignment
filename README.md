The exercise consists in getting some Wikipedia articles and building a binary classifier for them – in the next two weeks.
* Pick two Wikipedia categories (e.g. Computer Science and Sports)
* Download 1000 articles of each category.
* Train a classifier that is able to distinguish between the two categories using the plain text of an article (classification algorithm of your choice). Please use at least 5 classifiers, and at least one neural net.
* Test the classifier on 100 articles of each class (unseen during training) and report the results. Discuss the results, plot them nicely – this is the most important part.
